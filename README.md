# Pebblism Core

This mod was written to improve compatability for the Pebblism 3 modpack, and does the following:

- Include the functionality of Capacity in the Amphibious enchantment (but not remove Capacity from the allowed enchantment pool, you need to do that yourself \[just add `create:capacity` to `disallowedEnchantments` in config/enchancement.json])
