# Create: Enchancement

Do you like and want to use both Create and Enchancement, but feel frustrated by the mild inconsistencies between the
two? Look no further! This miniscule mod does the following:

- Include the functionality of Capacity in the Amphibious enchantment (but not remove Capacity from the allowed enchantment pool, you need to do that yourself \[just add `create:capacity` to `disallowedEnchantments` in config/enchancement.json])
